1. The UI and functional design of this software come from my daily working habits, which is equivalent to the program implementation of my working mode. With the increase of user feedback, many people's improvements have been absorbed and implemented.

2. I like to use vscode to work very much. I am also a J-type personality, so using to-do list is my absolute need.

3. I like things that are simple and practical.
