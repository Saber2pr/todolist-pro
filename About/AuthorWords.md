1. The UI and functional design of this software come from my daily working habits, which is equivalent to the program implementation of my working mode. With the increase of user feedback, many people's improvements have been absorbed and implemented.

2. I like to use vscode to work very much. I am also a J-type personality, so using to-do list is my absolute need.

3. I like things that are simple and practical.

4. In a software, there are open source parts and closed source parts. Generally speaking, the public ones are free, and the private ones require payment, just like Github's Pro plan. Free functions are free from the beginning to the end, and a function is not allowed to suddenly switch from free to paid.
