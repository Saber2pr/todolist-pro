# 📢 Important Notice: Login and Cloud Sync Services Will Be Discontinued

Dear users,

Thank you for your continued support!

Due to increasing server maintenance costs, we regret to inform you that **our software will no longer support login and cloud synchronization features**. Additionally, the **web version of the software will be permanently shut down**.

To avoid data loss, **please make sure to export and back up your cloud data to your local device as soon as possible**. Once the cloud service is closed, you will no longer be able to access your account or cloud-stored data.

---

## ❗Features to Be Discontinued:

* User login
* Cloud sync (including cloud backup and cross-device data syncing)
* Web version access

---

## ✅ Local Use Will Continue:

You can continue using the software **offline** through the following platforms:

* **Desktop application**
* **VS Code extension**

These versions will function fully **without requiring a login or an internet connection**.

> ⚠️ Please make sure to **upgrade to the latest offline-supported version** to ensure uninterrupted usage after cloud services are disabled.

---

## 📦 What You Should Do Now:

1. Log in and export your important cloud data
2. Back up the data safely on your local devices
3. Upgrade your desktop and VS Code versions to the **offline-ready release**
4. Verify the exported data to ensure everything is accessible locally

---

## ⏰ Deadline for Action:

**Please complete all backups and updates by August 31, 2025.**

After this date, we will no longer be able to recover cloud data or assist with login-related issues.

---

We sincerely appreciate your understanding and support through this transition. Our team will continue to focus on delivering a reliable and efficient offline experience.
